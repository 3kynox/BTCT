# GUNTHY-GUI OVERALL ARCHITECTURE (WIP)

![](https://i.imgur.com/RuTE0AQ.png)

You will find on this repository two branches that will permit to craft your builds :

- **sass-dev**: You'll find two main folders `client/` and `server/`
  - for that branch, base nodejs folders for development and runtime occur inside it
- **sass-prod**: Will be updated at some points and ...
  - ... you'll find in base directory only one package.json (instead of two for the sass-dev branch base folders)
  - ... it will be the candidate branch to be pushed in `master` once merge operation and build code have been updated
  
> The full build process guide from start to end will be detailed later

Stay tuned !
